/*For your third and final task, Little Lemon need to verify a booking, and decline any reservations for tables that are already booked under another name. 
Since integrity is not optional, Little Lemon need to ensure that every booking attempt includes these verification and decline steps.
However, implementing these steps requires a stored procedure and a transaction. 
To implement these steps, you need to create a new procedure called AddValidBooking. 
This procedure must use a transaction statement to perform a rollback if a customer reserves a table thatâ€™s already booked under another name.  
Use the following guidelines to complete this task:
The procedure should include two input parameters in the form of booking date and table number.
It also requires at least one variable and should begin with a START TRANSACTION statement.
Your INSERT statement must add a new booking record using the input parameter's values.
Use an IF ELSE statement to check if a table is already booked on the given date. 
If the table is already booked, then rollback the transaction. If the table is available, then commit the transaction. */
